# DevOps Screener

This screener page helps us get to know a bit more about you. This screener helps us fairly compare candidates.

There are three sections:

1. Current skills.

2. Past results.

3. Future decisions.

Each section has three short questions. 

You can can timebox each section to 10 minutes.

## Current skills

Please read this simplified example of a DevOps maturity model, 
then there are a few questions.

**Level 1: Initiate**

* Tools: Basic automation for build, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines.

* Themes: Basic monitoring, logging, alerting, and issue tracking.

* Teams: Basic communication between technical teams and technical vendors.

**Level 2: Standardize**

* Tools: Infrastructure as code (IaC) practices.

* Themes: Automated testing, deployment, provisioning, and configuration.

* Teams: Squad-wide collaboration, and dedicated communications channels.

**Level 3: Orchestrate**

* Tools: Continuous autoscaling, self-healing, anti-fragile adaptivity.

* Themes: Emphasis on continuous improvement and opportunity-driven decisions.

* Teams: Organization-wide leverage for sales, support, compliance, etc.

## Past results

Please read this simplified example of DevOps yearly goal plan,
then there are a few questions.

**Goal: Improve Customer Availability**

* Target 1: Increase uptime to 99.99% for all customer-facing applications. Measure by synthetic users.

* Target 2: Speed up incident response by reducing mean time to remediate (MTTR) by 20%. Measure by MTTR timing.

**Goal: Establish Internal Observability**

* Target 1: Implement system quality attribute monitoring for DORA metrics. Measure by % complete at 25% per metric.

* Target 2: Establish service level objectives (SLOs) for our 10 critical services. Measure by number of SLOs signed.

### Questions

In your past work, what was your most-important goal (or objective, or plan, etc.) and the goal's most-important targets (or results, or outcomes, etc.)?

* Goal:
  
* Target 1:
  
* Target 2:

## Future decisions

Please read this simplified example of a DevOps decision record.
then there are a few questions.

**Title**: Add tooling to improve continuous delivery pipeline

**Issue**: The DevOps team has identified the need to replace the existing CI/CD tool with a more scalable and feature-rich solution. The current tool lacks capabilities required for automated testing and deployment orchestration.

**Assumptions**: Must work with our existing toolchain, including version control (e.g. Git), ticket tracking (e.g. Trello), and container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes).

**Options**: Tool 1 provides parallel execution to distributed architectures, and support for large monorepos; cost is $100/developer/year; product is a monolith, cloud-only, closed source. Tool 2 is a plugin framework, with a community of 10K developers, and a dependence on polyrepos; product is microservice-based, on-premise only, open source.

### Questions

In your future decisions such as this, how will you proceed?

* I will especially seek:

* I will evaluate by doing:
  
* I will decide when:
