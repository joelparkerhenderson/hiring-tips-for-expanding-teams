### Questions

* Which tools do you use most now, and how, and why?
  
* What are themes that are important to you now?

* How are your team skills, such as soft skills?

## Past experiences

Please read this simplified example of a DevOps decision record.
then there are a few questions.

### DevOps decision record

**Title**: Add tooling to improve continuous delivery pipeline

**Issue**: The DevOps team has identified the need to replace the existing CI/CD tool with a more scalable and feature-rich solution. The current tool lacks capabilities required for automated testing and deployment orchestration.

**Assumptions**: Must work with our existing toolchain, including version control (e.g. Git), ticket tracking (e.g. Trello), hosting platform (e.g. Amazon Web Services), and container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes).

**Options**: Tool 1 provides parallel execution to distributed architectures, and support for large monorepos; cost is $100/developer/year; product is a monolith, cloud-only, closed source. Tool 2 is a plugin framework, with a community of 10K developers, and a dependence on polyrepos; product is microservice-based, on-premise only, open source.

### Questions

* What was one of your decisions and your decision-making process?

* How did you evaluate among options then decide on one?
  
* What lessons did you learn?

## Future goals

Please read this simplified example of a DevOps goal list,
then there are a few questions.

### DevOps goal list

**Goal 1: Improve Customer Availability**

* Target: Increase uptime to 99.99% for all customer-facing applications. 

* Metric: Measure by synthetic user interactions with the application.

**Goal 2: Create Internal Observability**

* Target: Implement system quality attribute monitoring for DORA metrics. 
  
* Metric: Measure by dashboard visibility of each of the four metrics (25% each).

**Goal 3: Specify Critical System Quality Attributes**

* Target: Establish service level objectives (SLOs) for our top 10 critical services. 
  
* Metric: Measure by number of SLOs signed by their respective accountable leads.

### Questions

* What top 3 goals do you imagine for a year of working together?
  
* Where will you target and why?
  
* How will you measure progress and success?
