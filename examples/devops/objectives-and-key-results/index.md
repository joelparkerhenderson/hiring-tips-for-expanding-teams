DevOps Objectives and Key Results

## Objective 1: Improve Deployments

Key Result 1: Increase system availability to 99.99% uptime for all customer-facing applications. Measure by vendor monitoring with synthetic users.

Key Result 2: Enhance incident response capabilities by reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to remediate (MTTR) security incidents by 20%. Measure by MTTD & MTTR timing.

### Objective 2: Establish Observables

Key Result 1: Implement centralized logging and monitoring solutions to achieve real-time visibility into system health and performance. Measure by dashboard visibility of four DORA metrics (20% each) plus min/mean/max RTT (20%) to have a synthetic user submit an order.

Key Result 2: Establish service level objectives (SLOs) and error budgeting for known critical services (n=20) to ensure reliability and availability goals are met. Measure by percent of known critical services with documented SLOs signed by accountable business owners.

### Objective 3: Foster Collaboration

Key Result 1: Implement cross-functional DevOps teams with representation from development, operations, and QA, with NPS > 0. Measure by NPS of stakeholders.

Key Result 2: Speed up responsiveness of DevOps cross-team code review participation by 20% to promote knowledge sharing and improve code quality. Measure by code review mean time to review.
