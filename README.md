# Hiring when you don't know

If you are seeking to hire help, yet don't know the industry, project, role, or responsbilties very well, then you're at a disadvantage. This is because you don't have firsthand knowledge of how to evaluate candidates, their current skills, their past results, or their future  potential.

We welcome feedback: what do you like about this information, what do you feel ar eopportunities for improvement, and how has this information affected your hiring practices?


## What do you need?

You need to be able to evaluate your candidates using three major perspectives:

1. Assess current skills.

2. Assess past results.

3. Assess future potential.


## What do we recommend?

First and foremost, we recommend you take time to learn more. 

* Can you learn more about the industry, the project, the role, the responsibilities, and so forth? For example, you may want to understand something of the options, scopes, and needs.

* Can you reach out to teammates, peers, and practioners, to gather advice from people who are doing well in a similar area, and can help point you the right direction? For example, you may want to create an assessment, or rubric, or interview script.

* Can you connect with a professional advisor, such as a recruiter, human resources manager, or job placement person, to get advice and possibly leads as well? For example, you may want to get feedback on a job description, or placement processes, or applicant screening systems.


## What if you're low on time?

If you're in a time crunch, such as with an immovable deadline, or mission-critical project, or unchageable procurement process, then you might not have enough time to connect with people who can advise you.

For this situation, we recommend you consider three technical-oriented tactics that you can pick up right now that may help you with hiring:

1. Assess current skills via maturity models.

2. Assess past results via objectives and key results.

3. Assess future potential via decision records.

The next three sections explain each of these tactics in more detail.


## Assess current skills via maturity models

Overview: [Maturity Models](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/maturity-models/)

* Maturity models (MM) are a simple ways of summarizing a group's capabilities, typically on a scale of 1 (meaning lowest) to 5 (meaning highest).

* A maturity model is often shown as a simple 5x5 table of five capabilty areas as rows, and  five capabilty levels 1-5 that describe some specifics.

Steps: 

1. Find any typical maturity model (MM) that's relevant for your role. If you know people doing the role, ask them for MMs; otherwise, a typical web search is fine. Provide the MM to the candidate to prepare for screening. 

2. During automatic screening, ask the candidate to choose the maturity level areas that feel most similar to their capabilities, and provide one sentence of justification for each area (such as 5), and optionally comment on the maturity model in general. Timebox 10 minutes.

3. During an interview, ask the candidate to drill into each of the chosen areas and each of the justification sentences. Seek areas where the canididate can describe specifics about the areas' implementations, as well as the candidate's accomplishments (i.e. past experience) and career goals (i.e. future goals). Timebox 10 minutes.

Gotchas: Some people dislike the concept of a "Maturity Model", or criticize it as "homogenization boxing" or "the map is not the territory" or "unnecessary overhead". Therefore emphasize that the purpose of this evaluation is to talk about how to productively summarize skill sets to be able to evaluate past work areas and current organizational capabilties.

* If you encounter a critic: ask them what they recommend instead and why.

* Send your feedback: do you have another way that you assess this area? Please let us know!

Bonus: If the candidate intiates anything about organizational orchestration/optimization, or mission-led growth comparisions with product-led growth, or learning and growth specifics.


## Assess past results via objectives and key results

Overview: [Objectives and Key Results](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives-and-key-results)

* Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a simple way of summarizing a group's goals and progress over time period such as a quarter or year. 

* Objectives and Key Results are typically shared throughout teams and organizations, to help improve collaboration and coordination.

Steps: 

1. Find any typical yearly planning technique that's relevant for your role. If you know people doing the role, ask them for their OKRs or equivalents; otherwise, a typical web search is fine. Provide your role's best-guess anonymized OKRs to the candidate to prepare for screening. 

2. During automatic screening, ask the candidate to provide one sentence of justification for how they match the OKR, and optionally comment on the OKRs in general. Timebox 10 minutes.

3. During an interview, ask the candidate to drill into each of the chosen areas and each of the justification sentences. Timebox 10 minutes.

Gotchas: Some people dislike the concept of "Objectives and Key Results", or criticize it negatively as "enterprise-speak" or "startup cargo culting" or "unspecified unpredicatability". Therefore emphasize that the purpose of this evaluation is to talk about the candidate's past objectives/goals/plans and results/outputs/outcomes the candidate has actually completed.

* If you encounter a critic: ask them what they recommend instead and why.

* Send your feedback: do you have another way that you assess this area? Please let us know!

Bonus: If the candidate intiates anything about organizational alignment vertically (e.g. team of teams, or manging up) or horizontally (e.g. inter-team coordination, or dotted-line deliverables), SMART criteria, or project planning techniques such as critical path or critical chain.


## Assess future potential via decision records

Overview: [Decision Record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/decision-record)

* Decision Records (DRs) are a process for evaluating among choices, especially to solve specific needs, and especially to solicit input from teams then integrate it.

* Decision Records (ADRs) can be especially useful for interviewing candiates, because DRs are negotiations and experiments, thus good for driving discussions.

Steps: 

1. Find any typical DR that's relevant for your role. If you know people doing the role, ask them for ADRs; otherwise, a typical web search is fine. Provide the DR to the candidate to prepare for screening.

2. During automatic screening, ask the candidate to provide one sentence of review for each significant assertion (such as 5), and optionally comment on the DR in general. Timebox 10 minutes.

3. During an interview, ask the candidate to drill into the DR and each of the justification sentences. Seek areas where the candidate can describe specific tradeoffs and options, as well as lessons learned (i.e. past experience) that can help the team with upcoming decisions (i.e. future growth). Timebox 10 minutes.

Gotchas: Some people dislike the concept of an "Decision Record", or criticize it as "architecture astronauting" or "death by documentation" or "pointless processing". Therefore emphasize that the purpose of this evaluation is to talk about how a team works on potential choices, and how they choose to collaborate and communicate about future decisions and decision-making teamwork.

* If you encounter a critic: ask them what they recommend instead and why.

* Send your feedback: do you have another way that you assess this area? Please let us know!

Bonus: If the candidate initiates anything about experiment-driven decision making, or lightweight decision coordination, or meeting preparation memos, or "disagree and commit", or "easily reversible decisions".


## Conclusion

This page covered how you can evaluate your candidates using three major perspectives and three technical-oriented tactics:

1. Assess current skills via maturity models.

2. Assess past results via objectives and key results.

3. Assess future collaboration via decision records.

We're well aware that there are many hiring guides, and hiring experts, and many of them prefer different ways. As always, do your own research and find what works for you. We welcome hearing from you, and we welcome your feedback.
